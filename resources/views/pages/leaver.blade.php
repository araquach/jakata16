        <h1>Matt now at our sister salon<br> Paul Kemp Hairdressing</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Matthew Lane is no longer working at Jakata (as of Saturday 29th July). He has moved to our sister salon <em>Paul Kemp Hairdressing</em></strong></p>
        <p>The change came about due to a stylist leaving at Paul Kemp Hairdressing and the position needed to be filled. Matt was happy to help out and make the move over.</p>
        <p>As a loyal client of Matt's we hope you will be happy to follow him across to the other salon, where you will be given the same high quality service you've experienced at Jakata.</p>
        
        <p class="details_text"><strong>If you already have an appointment with Matt, it will stay exactly the same - he will see you over at PK!</strong></p>
